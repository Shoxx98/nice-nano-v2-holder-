# nice-nano-v2-holder-
holder for the nice!nano v2 without a shroud for dactyl manuform keyboards, similar to the (fork from carbonfet)[https://github.com/carbonfet/dactyl-manuform], where the shell of the keyboard part has a window into the case. 

I just glued this one to the bottom plate where the window into the case is.
