# nice-nano-v2-holder-
holder for the nice!nano v2 without a shroud for dactyl manuform keyboards, similar to the (fork from carbonfet)[https://github.com/carbonfet/dactyl-manuform], where the shell of the keyboard part has a window into the case. 

I just glued this one to the bottom plate where the window into the case is.
I intended there to be three latches that work but ended up snapping off the hook part of the front two latches.
It is very secure against horizontal movement and somewhat secure against vertical movement, which a lot of the other holders are missing out on in my opinion.
